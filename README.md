# Learning React by Example

Welcome to my (hopefully) helpful teaching tool for taking your very first steps toward making an app in React!  This project was made in early March of 2022, so please be aware that depending on how long it's been since then, React has likely changed!  Time erodes even the greatest structures, and JS libraries are no exception.  If you find this guide to be brokenly out of date, please file an issue so I can adjust things!

## Is This Tool For Me?

If you have:

- An interest in learning React
- Some experience with JavaScript
- Experience with HTML/CSS

If you want:

- To learn by doing
- Clearly marked challenges
- To have a tangible app to take home

This tool is likely for you!  React is fun, but there's a bit of a learning curve, as with all libraries and frameworks.  I've done the best I can to assume very little knowledge of React and JS concepts, so this is a good project for a newcomer.  Feel free to Google around if you don't understand something or want to learn more about how React works.  I wanted to keep the comments limited to instructions for the project, so reading up on the React documentation is always a good idea!  You might even learn something that I don't know about yet.

# React App Documentation

I've decided to preserve the Create React App documentation here in case you'd like information about how to run the app (sounds useful, right?).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
